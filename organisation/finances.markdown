<h1>Finances & Funding</h1>

<p>Tiefblick Foundation is funded through a combination of grants, donations, and proceeds from Tiefblick Studio's technology sale and game licensing/sales. Our financial approach is centered on sustainability, ensuring both the well-being of our team and the long-term impact of our projects.</p>

<p>Tiefblick Studio doesn't aim to compete with industry salaries but provides a model which will channel profits back into the foundation and pay bonuses to partners when products reach social impact goals and financial success. Tiefblick can at this stage not offer a primary source of income but aims to become a solid provider of sustainable side income in the long run - grants and funding will be used to provide compensation in form of a living wage for those who are in need to supplement their primary income.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Grants and Donations</strong>: We apply for grants to fund specific initiatives and accept donations from those who share our vision.</li>
    <li><strong>Game & Technology Sales</strong>: The proceeds from our games help cover operational costs and support new community-focused initiatives.</li>
    <li><strong>Transparency</strong>: We believe in financial transparency and make our financial reports available to the public, ensuring accountability and trust.</li>
</ul>
