<h1>Organisation</h1>


<h2>Tiefblick Foundation and Studio</h2>

<p><strong>Tiefblick Foundation, derived from the German word for "deep perception" or "deep insight,"</strong> is a charitable trust based in New Zealand. Our mission is to help people understand their inner and outer worlds better, primarily through storytelling and community engagement. One of our key initiatives is Tiefblick Studio, which focuses on game development. Through this arm, we aim to leverage the power of games to inspire personal growth, build positive social impact, and nurture talent.</p>

<p><strong>Tiefblick Studio</strong> operates as the social impact game development arm of the Foundation, creating games that focus on personal growth and addressing important societal topics. Our approach is centered around collaboration, creativity, and community engagement to ensure that every voice is heard, and our games make meaningful contributions to the well-being of individuals and society.</p>
