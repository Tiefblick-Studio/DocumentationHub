<h1>Structure</h1>

<img src="{{ '/assets/images/structure.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Structure Image - Foundation with Social Impact Game Studio Arm">
<p><b>Tiefblick</b> follows a flat organizational model that values transparency, inclusivity, and empowerment for all members. While Tiefblick Foundation is an umbrella organisation to provide young people with opportunities for introspection, growth and empowering them to find their voice, Tiefblick Studio is the first of maybe many ways we can reach youth. While we believe that a non-hierarchical structure helps encourage creativity, autonomy, and mutual trust, the Foundation is a safeguard to keep the game studio and possible other arms accountable.</p>
<p><b>Tiefblick Foundation</b>, as the umbrella organisation, can receive and invest money into community initiatives that are in alignment with the trust deed, invest directly into youth by giving them the opportunities to be mentored, and safeguards the alignment of the for profit arm(s). Conflict of Interest needs to be considered when applying for grants - as they can not directly be used for the for profit arm(s):</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Board Members</strong> (3 individuals): Provide oversight and strategic direction for the organization.</li>
    <li><strong>Partners</strong>:
        <ul>
            <li><em>Community Outreach</em>: Focus on developing and managing community initiatives.</li>
            <li><em>Finance</em>: Handle budgeting and financial planning.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tiefblick Studio</strong>, as a part of the Foundation, is made up of passionate individuals who take collective responsibility for game development:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Product Management</strong>: Oversees the overall product vision.</li>
    <li><strong>Design</strong>: Leads the game design process, including gameplay and user experience.</li>
    <li><strong>Art</strong>: Handles the visual aesthetics of the game.</li>
    <li><strong>Development</strong>: Manages coding and technical implementation.</li>
    <li><strong>Marketing</strong>: Develops and implements marketing strategies.</li>
    <li><strong>Community Engagement</strong>: Engages with players and the local community.</li>
</ul>

Or in Tai's words:

<code><em>The goal is to establish a sustainable company, implementing collaborative working.<br>
For this to happen, all people involved in the project must take ownership of Tiefblick, or maybe we should say "take shareship".<br>
Tiefblick is ours, Tiefblick is us.<br>
Think of it as a Collaborative Organisation, a Society, a Fellowship.<br>
It is new, it is disruptive, it is revolution. :)<br>
<br>
As much as Tiefblick wants to escape the norm, a legally binding structure is required for it to exist.<br>
The structure that seems to be the best approach is a Charitable Trust operating as a Social Enterprise.<br>
Such a structure allows Tiefblick to be a non-profit while still generating revenue and paying salaries.<br>
There are no owners. There are trustees who ensure that Tiefblick's vision and values are upheld.<br>
All involved are stakeholders and get paid the same salary, in a flat hierarchy.</em></code>
