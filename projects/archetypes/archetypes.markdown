<h1>Archetypes - The Rite of Passage</h1>
<b>NEEDS REWORK/REWORDING</b><br>
The first project is in its demo version and it is called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2096720/ARCHETYPES__The_Rite_Of_Passage/" target="_blank">ARCHETYPES - The Rite Of Passage</a>.<br>
This game has as its goal to empower young males to find their archetype in the game, and consequentially understand their strengths and how to insert themselves in society.<br>
ARCHETYPES is the first concept from the studio, and has a very specific target audience, as it is closely tied to Dom's personal journey.<br>
A possible next project is a counterpart of ARCHETYPES for young females.<br>
The ultimate goal is to have non-binary projects and options to offer to the community, to improve learning, self-esteem, skills, etc.<br>
No such thing as games only focused on boys. :)
