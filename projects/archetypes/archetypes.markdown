<h1>Archetypes - The Rite of Passage</h1>
<h3>Summary</h3><br>
A self-exploration journey, aiming to support young males to understand their own archetypal blueprint and find their confidence in a world of ever-changing definition of healthy masculinity.
<br><br>
<h3>>Concept</h3><br>
”Archetypes - The Rite of Passage” is an interactive game experience designed to inspire young men
on their journey toward self-understanding and growth, while directly addressing the stigma
surrounding mental distress.<br>
We aim to challenge the prevailing social expectations of men,
particularly the notion of stoicism, which often leads to isolation and deepens feelings of depression,
a key factor in the high rates of male suicide.
<br><br>
<h3>Target Audience</h3><br>
Our primary focus is on young men, aged 13-24, who may be struggling with feelings of isolation,
depression, or anxiety, but who are also influenced by societal pressures to ”tough it out” on their
own.<br>
Extending the target audience to include teenagers allows us to reach individuals at a critical
stage in their development, where they are beginning to form their understanding of masculinity,
mental health, and social expectations.<br>
By addressing these themes earlier, we can help shape
healthier perspectives before harmful attitudes and behaviours become deeply ingrained.
<br><br>
<h3>Behavioural Change</h3><br>
We hope to shift attitudes toward mental distress by presenting healthier models of masculinity—
ones that embrace vulnerability, connection, and community. By giving them an immersive, storydriven experience grounded in Carl Jung’s archetypes, they can gain insight into their inner selves and
learn to navigate life’s challenges with a broader set of tools.
<br><br>
<h3>Outcomes and Impact</h3><br>
The primary outcome we seek is a shift in attitudes among young men toward seeking support and
embracing vulnerability. We aim to provide young men with an experience that challenges their
internalized beliefs about masculinity, allowing them to explore the consequences of their choices
within a safe, narrative-driven environment. By offering multiple story paths, players can engage with
different facets of their psyche, ultimately guiding them toward healthier, more supportive behaviours
in real life.
<br>
We plan to support this experience with educational materials for teachers, mentors, and community
leaders. These resources will facilitate meaningful discussions after gameplay, helping young men
process the lessons learned and apply them to their own lives. Additionally, we are exploring the
possibility of running community events that allow those without access to traditional support
systems to experience the game and its messages.
