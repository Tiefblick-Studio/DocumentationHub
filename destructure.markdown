<h1>(De)Structure</h1>
The goal is to establish a sustainable company, implementing collaborative working.<br>
For this to happen, all people involved in the project must take ownership of Tiefblick, or maybe we should say "take shareship".<br>
Tiefblick is ours, Tiefblick is us.<br>
Think of it as a Collaborative Organisation, a Society, a Fellowship.<br>
It is new, it is disruptive, it is revolution. :)<br>
<br>
As much as Tiefblick wants to escape the norm, a legally binding structure is required for it to exist.<br>
The structure that seems to be the best approach is a Charitable Trust operating as a Social Enterprise.<br>
Such a structure allows Tiefblick to be a non-profit while still generating revenue and paying salaries.<br>
There are no owners. There are trustees who ensure that Tiefblick's vision and values are upheld.<br>
All involved are stakeholders and get paid the same salary, in a flat hierarchy.
